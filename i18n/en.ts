  menu_description: `The menu at Big Spuntino is a warm tribute to Italy’s culinary heritage. From <em>insalata</em>, <em>caprese</em>,and octopus to the crispiest <em>foccacia</em>, our menu offers an exquisite selection of classic <em>spuntini</em> ("snacks"). This also applies to the <em>dolci</em>: from the traditional crème the mascarpone to the fluffy light <em>maritozzi</em>, we sweeten everyday life with <em>churros all italiana</em>. Pair it with a cocktail, spritz, or our signature Spuntino 75.`,

          togetherness — not only in the day bar itself, but also in private or business venues. Reach out to
          our team to create tailor-made events for your most cherished moments.`,
  our_history: `<span>
                Since the summer of <strong>2025</strong>, the <strong>Big Spuntino</strong> has been the second Italian
                centerpiece of host <strong>Dario Pittarello</strong>. Dario opened the “Ristorante Pittarello” at
                Mühlenkamp in Hamburg-Winterhude back in 2015 and has since served his guests with fine, authentic Italian cuisine.

                But that wasn’t enough – Dario couldn’t miss the chance to expand next door, where he now welcomes old and new guests
                in a warm and lively <em>day bar</em> with <strong>spettacoloso snacks</strong> and drinks from Italian cuisine.

                The <strong>bright red interior</strong> with classic wood and brass elements offers the perfect place for the
                “big times” – from boozy brunches and daily lunches to early aperitivo.
